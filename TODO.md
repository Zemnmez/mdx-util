TODO
====

- fix mdx.macro auto-refresh
- update mdx.macro to include same set of remark/rehype/textr plugins as mdx-loader
- tests for:
  - mdx-constant
  - mdx-loader (see how @mdx-js/loader does it)
  - mdx-table-of-contents
- add option for mdx-loader that *only* exports frontMatter and tableOfContents
  (and leaves everything else out), test it (useful for meta in large websites like frontarm)
